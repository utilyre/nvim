## üì¶ Installation

0. (Optional) Take a backup of your existing Neovim config

   ```bash
   mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.back
   mv ~/.local/share/nvim ~/.local/share/nvim.back
   ```

1. Clone this repository onto `~/.config/nvim`

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/utilyre/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
   ```

2. Open up `nvim` and wait for [lazy.nvim][lazy.nvim] to do its job. Once it's
   done re-open `nvim` to make sure everything is good to go.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Syntax highlighting via [tree-sitter][tree-sitter] and [nvim-treesitter][nvim-treesitter]

Type `:TSInstall ` while Neovim is open and press `<tab>`. You'll see a list of
**parsers** displayed under the prompt. Continue pressing `<tab>` until you get to
the desired parser and press `<cr>` to install.

**NOTE**: It's also possible to install all the parsers at once by executing
`:TSInstall all`.

[nvim-treesitter]: https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter

### Code Analysis/Intellisense via LSP (language server protocol)

If you're coming from VS Code (or practically any other IDE), you're used to
having code analysis/intellisense support out of the box or at the worst
scenario you would have to install an extension.

However, in Neovim, you've got to install the binaries manually. But don't
worry, thanks to [mason.nvim][mason.nvim] it became such a simple task to setup
LSP in Neovim too!

1. Press `<leader>ma` on your keyboard to open mason.

2. Search for the server you want to install if you know the name, otherwise
   press `<c-f>` and select a language so that the long list will narrow down to
   a few servers.

   **NOTE**: You can press `<cr>` on any item to get a bunch of useful
   information about it (brief description, URL, version, etc).

3. Install the server by pressing `i`.

4. Open a shell and change directory to user config folder

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.config/nvim/user # in case it's not already there
   cd ~/.config/nvim/user
   ```

5. Edit/Create `servers.lua` and paste the following in there

   ```lua
   local lspconfig = require("lspconfig")

   -- lspconfig.[lsp-name].setup({ [options] })
   ```

   As you see in the commented line, you can configure a server by calling the
   `setup` function. `setup` requires a table of options that will be used to
   configure the server. See [server_configurations][server_configurations] for
   more information

   **NOTE**: `[lsp-name]` isn't always the same as the binary you've installed
   from mason. See [server-mappings][server-mappings] for more information.

   This is an example of configuring [lua-language-server][lua-language-server]

   ```lua
   lspconfig.sumneko_lua.setup({
     settings = {
       Lua = {
         completion = {
           enable = true,
           callSnippet = "Replace",
           showWord = false,
           workspaceWord = false,
         },
         diagnostics = {
           enable = true,
           globals = { "vim" },
         },
         format = {
           enable = false,
         },
         hint = {
           enable = true,
         },
         hover = {
           enable = true,
           expandAlias = false,
         },
         runtime = {
           version = "LuaJIT",
         },
         workspace = {
           library = {
             [os.getenv("VIMRUNTIME") .. "/lua"] = true,
           },
         },
       },
     },
   })
   ```

### Formatters/Linters (e.g. [prettier][prettier])

1. Press `<leader>ma` on your keyboard to open mason.

2. Search for the formatter/linter you want to install.

   **NOTE**: You can press `<cr>` on any item to get a bunch of useful
   information about it (brief description, URL, version, etc).

3. Install the formatter/linter by pressing `i`.

4. Open a shell and change directory to user config folder

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.config/nvim/user # in case it's not already there
   cd ~/.config/nvim/user
   ```

5. Edit/Create `sources.lua` and paste the following in there

   ```lua
   local null = require("null-ls")

   -- null.register(null.builtins.[type].[name])
   ```

   See [builtins][builtins] (place contents of `sources` table inside
   `null.register`'s parentheses).

## üíª Plugin Development

In case you do some Neovim plugin development, here's how you would do it in
this config

1. Set `NVIM_DEV` environment variable to your project's directory. So if you
   keep the plugin you're working on at `~/Repos/mycoolplugin.nvim`, you
   should add the following to your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.

   ```bash
   export NVIM_DEV="$HOME/Repos"
   ```

2. Create a file under `lua/config/plugins` of this repository with the
   following content (continuing with the `mycoolplugin.nvim` example)

   ```lua
   -- lua/config/plugin/mycoolplugin.lua
   local spec = {
     "[user]/mycoolplugin.nvim", -- substitute [user] with your github username
     dev = true,
   }

   function spec.config()
     require("mycoolplugin").setup()
   end

   return spec
   ```
